<p><h1>About Bukukha /Buguga</h1>

    Inzu Ya Masaba was created in 2010 with the aim of preserving and fostering the culture of the Bamasaba, the cultural institution which comprise s members from 26 clans across Bugisu sub region. <br>
    
    The Bamasaba cultural institution aka Inzu Ya Masaba has been bogged down by leadership wrangles that worsened with the death of Bob Mushikori in 2021.
    <br>
    After Mushikori’s death, two parallel search committees for a new Umukukha were instituted by parallel factions, resulting in the election of two rival cultural heads for the same institution; Mr Jude Mudoma and Mr. John Wagabyalire.
    <br>
    In the renewed efforts by the government to settle the impasse between the two factions, the minister of state for gender and cultural affairs Ms Peace Mutuuzo on July 14 wrote the former Umukukha [Emeritus Umukukha Wilson Wamimbi I] asking him to convene a meeting of 26 clan leaders to resolve the issue “within 30 days from the date of reception of the letter”
    <br>
    Division and intrigue intensified among Bugisu political leaders over the pending gazettement of the new Umukukha.
    <br>
    This voting by elders comes after the Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development, Mr Frank Tumwebaze, in his April 6 letter declined to gazette any of the parallel elected cultural leaders.
    <br>
    Mr Tumwebaze instead asked the leaders to utilise Section 16 of the Institution of Traditional or Cultural Leaders Act, 2011 to settle their disputes before reporting to his office.
    <br>
    <h1>The fights</h1>
    
    Inzu Ya Masaba has had warring factions for long ever since the reign of Late Umukukha/Umuguga, Bob Mushikori II [Mubuya] with fights ranging from poor representation, financial scandals and failure to popularise the institution across Bugisu sub-region.
    <br>
    Not so long ago, Joseph Kanyanya from Bududa relayed unjustifiable claims to the Bugisu/Bamasaba cultural throne.
    <br>
    As reported in 2008, Kanyanya claimed that President Yoweri Museveni had recognised Bikuuka/Biguga bya Bamasaba (clans of Bamasaba) kingdom. This was, however, refuted as letters purportedly written by the Presidential principal private secretary were said to be forged.
    <br>
    This kind of unpopular politicking yielded no positive results for him and since then he formed Babukusu kingdom in Bududa and declared himself Umukhongo Bukusu.
    <br>
    In another twist of events, an 80-year-old Shaban Wambedde Wataba of Nabugoya village in Namanyonyi sub-county, Mbale district says he is the rightful cultural leader (Umugasha) of the Bamasaba/Bagisu. He says he belongs to the royal family of the Bamasaba, where leadership is not elective, but inherited.
    <br>
    Although there is an approved constitution that governs the institution where Umukukha/Umuguga is to serve for a non-renewable term of five years, there were attempts during Late Umukukha [Umuguga] II Mushikori’s reign to change the constitution to allow the reigning Umukukha/Umuguga more years.
    <br>
    The new Umuguga Mudoma should make this a plausible position which is accommodative and focused on cultural restoration must be well-documented and records kept in a safe place for future reference, lest the Bugisu/Bamasaba cultural throne be plunged into political and social disorder again.
    <br>
    The Bamasaba/ Bagisu occupy six districts Sironko, Bulambuli, Mbale, Bududa, Namisindwa, and Manafwa and Western Kenya where they are referred to as the Babukusu are estimated to be seven million people.
    <br>
   <h1> About the Bamasaba/Bagisu Monarchy</h1>
    
    Historically, the Bagisu, fondly referred to as Bamasaba did not have a monarchy. The Bamasaba/Bugisu cultural heritage is centered on clanship and these clans play a big role in the local communities here to date.
    <br>
    According to many Bagisu/Bamasaba scholars, monarchism [Inzu Ya Masaba] is a recent development among the Bamasaba, an ethnic tribe living on the slopes of Mt Elgon.
    <br>
    But even then, it is imperative to note that the spirit of the 1995 constitution was to “RETURN” not to “CREATE” kings for whoever wanted to assert himself. This implies that the children of Masaba who had historical institutions equivalent to a monarchy do not deserve to have these leaders in whatever name.
    <br>
    Traditionally, the Bagisu had chiefs all over with no supreme leader above them. It is therefore a creation and is a new institution among the Bagisu and this probably explains why the institution is not respected.
    <br>
    Among the Bamasaba/ Bagisu, it was Imbalu/Ipalu and Arabica Coffee uniting them, the new cultural leader should therefore strive to make this cultural institution more acceptable and more relevant to forge unity among the Bagisu/Bamasaba.</p>
