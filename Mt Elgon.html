<H1>Mount Elgon National Park in Uganda</H1>
<P>Mount Elgon National Park is a UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve located along the border between Uganda and Kenya. The park covers an area of 494 square miles. A larger part (430 square miles) of the park is on the Ugandan side of the border. The Ugandan section was elevated from a forest reserve into a national park in 1992. The park gets its name from Mount Elgon which is a prominent physical feature in the park. Mount Elgon is an extinct volcano that erupted over twenty four million years ago. It is the highest volcanic mountain in East Africa and the 8th highest mountain in Africa. Mount Elgon has the largest caldera in the world which is about 60 kilometers long and 40 kilometers wide. This particular Caldera is a result of magma getting drained from the bottom leading to the collapse of the cone. Scientists believe that at one point in time, Mount Elgon was the highest mountain Africa before millions of years of erosion reduced its height substantially.</P>
<P>The fertile slopes of Mount Elgon encourage the group of vegetation that varies depending on altitude. They include montane forests in the lower areas, bamboo forests on higher grounds and alpine-moorlands towards the summit. Over 400 species of plants and 143 of birds have been recorded. Half of Uganda’s species of butterflies are found in Mount Elgon National Park with the endangered Maathai’s Lonleg dragonfly was discovered in 2000. The lower slopes of the mountains support a variety of mammals like black-and-white colobus Monkeys, blue monkeys, buffalos, elephants, red-tailed monkeys, spotted hyena, Oribi, Defassa waterbuck, Bushbucks and smaller antelopes.</P>
<img src="Images/FARMING ON MT ELGON.jpg" alt="farming on the fertile soils of mt elgon">
<p>The main tribes living in the Ugandan side of the park are the Sabiny and Bagisu.These tribes rely on subsistence farming. The Bagisu have specialized in the growing of Arabica coffee which does well in the fertile soils on the lower slopes of the mountains. The higher slopes of the mountains are protected and managed by the Uganda wildlife Authority in close cooperation with Kenyan counterparts. The Mountain Elgon national park office is located along Masaba Road in Mbale town. This is where tourists go to seek information or acquire permits for park related activities.</p>
<h1>Access Mount Elgon National Park</h1>
<img src="Images/sipi falls.jpg" alt="">
<p>The distance between Kampala city and Mount Elgon National Park is about 230km. The roads are well paved and made of tarmac but traffic jam is a problem on the Kampala – Jinja highway. It takes between 4 to 5 hours to reach Mbale town from Kampala through the towns of Jinja and Iganga. The journey by road offers opportunities to stop and see amazing places like the source of the river Nile and Mabira forest. From Mbale town, one needs to drive to the park offices outside the town or head straight to the nearest mountain climbing starting point in Budadiri. Visitors can hire a car or use public means to get to the park but arranging your travel with a good tour company is more convenient. <br>
    For visitors who don’t like long road journeys, there is an option to book a chartered flight from Entebbe international airport to Soroti airfield near Mount Elgon. From the airfield, one would need to travel by road for about one hour before reaching Mbale town or Kapchorwa.
    </p>
<h1>Attractions in Mount Elgon National Park</h1>
<img src="Images/sipi-falls-largejpg.jpg" alt="siipi falls">
<p>Mountain Elgon National Park is more known for mountain climbing and nature walks. Apart from reaching the peak, climbing Mount Elgon offers great opportunities to explore a massive caldera, caves, cliffs, gorges, hot springs, mesas and waterfalls. Mount Elgon National Park has a sizeable population of large mammals like elephants, buffaloes and primates. Apart from climbing the mountain, tourists visit the park for game viewing, nature walks, bird watching, cave exploration and camping. Activities can be arranged both inside and outside the park to places like the Sipi Falls and Wildlife reserves in Kapchorwa. </p>
<h1>Climbing Mount Elgon:</h1>
<p>Climbing Mount Elgon has its advantages compared to the Rwenzori Mountains or Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It is less expensive, less strenuous and with temperatures that are acceptable even at the summit. The unique thing about climbing Mount Elgon is not reaching the Wagagai peak but descending from the peak to spot the largest caldera on earth.</p>
<img src="Images/mountain_elgon_route.jpg" alt="climbing mt elgon">
<p> Climbing Mount Elgon takes between 4 to 6 days depending on the trail used. There are three main starting points – The Salsa Trail, Pisa Trail and Sipi trail. The Salsa Trail also known as the Buddukiro trailhead is a shorter trail but with very steep climbs. It starts from near Mbale town and takes only 4 days to reach the peak. Though it is the most direct route, it goes through the thickest area of the bamboo forests in the park.  The second trail is the Pisa trail also known as the Kapkwata trailhead. This trail starts from a forest in Kapkwata and passes through great Podocarpus forests. This is the longest (7 days) but with few steep areas. The trail provides opportunities to view the parks animals and birdlife. The third trail is the Sipi Trail which begins from the Kapkwai forest exploration center. It takes between 4 to 6 days to reach the peak through the Sipi trail. <br>

<p> In order to see the best of everything and see more of the mountain features, hikers can ascend via the Sipi Trail and descend using the Salsa trail. More adventurous hikers may start from the Ugandan side and descend at the Kenyan side. Hikers who choose to end their hike in Kenya need paperwork to cross the border.  The migration office in Mbale can help with acquiring the border crossing papers is required by their colleagues in the Kenyan side. <br>
    Before climbing to the top of the mountain, hikers need to report to the Uganda Wildlife Authority offices outside the main town. Climbing Mount Elgon costs $75 per day for international visitors including park entrance fees. The amount also covers ranger/guide fees. Hikers also need to hire porters and cooks to escort them and help setting up camp. It is a good practice to give extra tip to the guides, porters, cooks and even park rangers.
    </p>
    <h1>Exploring the Mount Elgon Caves: </h1>
    <p>Those who are not ready to go all the way up to the mountain peak can request for shorter day hikes or exploring some of the numerous caves on the slopes of the mountain.

    </p>
    <p>There are other ancient caves like those found in Budadiri with paintings from thousands of years ago. The Khauka and Kapkwai caves in Wanale are a favorite with visitors because of their structure and numerous bats that provide manure from their droppings. These caves were used as shelter by the local people and their domestic animals. <br> The Nyero Rock Painting Caves outside Mbale town are also worth a visit.

              <h1>How to plan for Mountain Elgon Hiking Safari in Uganda</h1>
              <p>•	Like any mountain that is above 2600 meters, there is a real possibility of getting altitude related sicknesses especially for first-time climbers. Altitude illnesses affect anyone without regarding former experience, fitness or age.</p>
              <p>•	You need to move with park rangers and porters when climbing to the top of the mountains or taking part in activities like wildlife viewing and camping. By hiring/employing these porters, you help support the local community and contribute to the overall conservation of the park and wild animals. When communities realize the benefits of tourism to the community, they are less inclined to poach park animals. The porters and rangers in the park are certified and trained in first aid treatment. The rangers share vital information about the different plant and animal species with visitors to the park. The overall cost of each guide shouldn’t exceed $15.</p>
              <p>•	The best time to visit Mount Elgon National Park is during the dry (June – August and December – March) seasons. It is important to note that hiking to the top of the mountain and all other park activities continue even during the wet/rainy season. It is also important to note that the mountain receives rainfall almost throughout the year. So expect rain even during the dry seasons in Uganda.</p>
              <p>•	A parking list for Mount Elgon national park should include bottled drinking water, enough food supplies, equipment for cooking, first aid kit, flashlight, gear for rain, hand gloves, a hat, hiking shoes, sleeping bag, a tent and warm clothing.</p>
